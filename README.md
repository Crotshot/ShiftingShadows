# ShiftingShadows

Shifting Shadows was a project game developed for Game Development Practicum module, this project
was created alone in Unity over the course of a semester.

In a fictional world all beings of evil magic had been cast into a series of underground prisons 
called the Abyss. This ushered in a golden era of peace for all the land, but the end times have
grown near and armageddon is at hand.

As prophosised the darkness will rise again reak havok across the world.  You play as demi-shade,
a half human half shade being which can use their dark magic to switch places with shadowy figures 
they create.

Escape the depths of the Abyss in this first person puzzle game in which the player uses their 
demi-shade abilities to solve puzzles and escape the immortal wardens of the abyss. Will you 
see the surface once more or will you perish in the Abyss forever more?
